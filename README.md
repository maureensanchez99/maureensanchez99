# Hi there, my name is Maureen 👋🏽👩🏽‍💻

I'm a student studying computer science at Hartnell College in Salinas, CA. I love what I study and am developing my skills so I can start a career in software development!

- 🤖 In my current classes we are learning Data Structures & Algorithms, Discrete Structures, and how to work with arduinos  
- 🌱 I’m looking for help with learning Spanish & Tagolog and developing my front-end language skills (i.e. HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript)
- 📫 Follow my journey on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maureen-sanchez/">LinkedIn</a> as I go through my academic career and gain experience for my future career
