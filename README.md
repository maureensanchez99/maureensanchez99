# Hi there, my name is Maureen 👋🏽👩🏽‍💻

I'm studying computer science at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA. I love what I study and am developing my skills so I can start a career in software development!  

- 💻 I’m currently working on an Arduino based project with LSU's BengalBots combat division where we are designing and building a bot that we can remotely operate to compete in a robot fight against other teams. 
- 🤖 I am learning how to work with arduinos through a project with LSU's BengalBots and cementing my computer science fundatmentals through the courses I am taking at LSU.  
- 🌱 I’m looking for help with developing my front-end language skills (i.e. HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript).
- 📫 Follow my journey on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maureen-sanchez/">LinkedIn</a> as I go through my academic career and gain experience for my future career.
- 🗃️ While you're here, check out my <a href="https://devpost.com/maureensanchez99">Devpost</a> and see all the projects I've submitted to hackathons. 
- 👩🏽 Pronouns: she/her 
- 🧵 Fun fact: I love to craft so at times when I'm not glued to my computer I'm making embroidery hoop art, plush dolls, or clothes.
